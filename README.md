I am a passionate data scientist who has broad programming and statistics skills. I would love to use these skills to solve various business problems by using machine learning, data mining, and other types of data analytics and data visualization tools such as Python, TensorFlow, Tableau, etc.

Coding aside, I enjoy listening to music and cat sitting.
